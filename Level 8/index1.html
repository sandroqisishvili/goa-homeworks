    <h1>About My Favorite Car</h1>
    <p>The E60 M5 was introduced in 2004, with a V10 engine and 7-speed paddle-shift SMG (Sequential Manual Gearbox) transmission linking the car with the BMW Sauber Formula One program.[48][49] The E60 M5 was the world's first production sedan to use a V10 gasoline engine. This generation of the M5 was also built in the E61 Touring (wagon) body style, which was only sold in Europe. The E63/E64 M6 coupé and convertible are based on a shortened version of the M5 chassis and largely use the same mechanical components.

        The official 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration figure is 4.7 seconds for the sedan,[50] however magazine tests have recorded figures down to 4.1 seconds.[51] The E60 M5 was the fastest 4-door sedan available at the time of its introduction;[52] top speed is electronically restricted to 250 km/h (155 mph)[50] but could be raised to 305 km/h (190 mph) with the optional M-driver's package.[53] The M5 has recorded a Nürburgring lap time</p>
